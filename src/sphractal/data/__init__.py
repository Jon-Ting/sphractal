Data
====

Contains 3D Cartesian atomic coordinates for nanoparticles used for
  - demonstration of Sphractal usage (octahedron), 
  - strong scaling tests (spheres with diameter of 100 nm), 
  - weak scaling tests and time complexity analysis (spheres of different sizes), 
  - validation of methodology (single atom), and 
  - case studies (ordered and disordered octahedrons, rhombic dodecahedrons, and tetrahedrons).
